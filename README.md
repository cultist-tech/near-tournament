Tournament
===================

This repository includes an implementation of a tournament contract.

Introduction
=============

Necessary for various tournaments on blockchain. A tournament is created (access via NFT as an option) with certain conditions (number of participants, entry price, distribution of funds between winners). Each participant contributes a predetermined amount of money, after the end of the tournament, all collected funds are distributed according to the terms of the tournament. Also anyone can contribute FT or NFT to the tournament prize fund.

Prerequisites
=============

  * Make sure Rust is installed per the prerequisites in [`near-sdk-rs`](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-rs).
  * Make sure [near-cli](https://github.com/near/near-cli) is installed.

=====================

The source for this contract is in `/src/lib.rs`.

Building this contract
======================
Run the following, and we'll build our rust project up via cargo. This will generate our WASM binaries into our `res/` directory. This is the smart contract we'll be deploying onto the NEAR blockchain later.
```bash
sh ./scripts/build.sh
```

Using this contract
===================

### Quickest deploy

You can build and deploy this smart contract to a development account. [Dev Accounts](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/account#dev-accounts) are auto-generated accounts to assist in developing and testing smart contracts. Please see the [Standard deploy](#standard-deploy) section for creating a more personalized account to deploy to.

```bash
sh ./scripts/dev-deploy.sh
```

Behind the scenes, this is creating an account and deploying a contract to it. On the console, notice a message like:

>Done deploying to dev-1234567890123

In this instance, the account is `dev-1234567890123`. A file has been created containing a key pair to
the account, located at `neardev/dev-account`. To make the next few steps easier, we're going to set an
environment variable containing this development account id and use that when copy/pasting commands.
Run this command to set the environment variable:

```bash
source ./scripts/neardev/dev-account.env
```

You can tell if the environment variable is set correctly if your command line prints the account name after this command:
```bash
echo $CONTRACT_NAME
```

The next command will initialize the contract using the `new` method:

```bash
near call $CONTRACT_NAME new_default_meta '{"owner_id": "'$CONTRACT_NAME'"}' --accountId $CONTRACT_NAME
```
